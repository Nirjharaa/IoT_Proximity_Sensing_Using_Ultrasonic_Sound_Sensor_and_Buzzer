# IoT_Proximity_Sensing_Using_Ultrasonic_Sound_Sensor_and_Buzzer

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is a device that can measure the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. It works by emitting a high-frequency sound (ultrasonic wave) and measuring the time it takes for the sound to bounce back (echo) to the sensor. The sensor then calculates the distance to the object based on the time it took for the sound to return.

Connect the VCC pin of the HC-SR04 sensor to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno. Connect the GND pin of the sensor to GND on the Arduino, the TRIG pin of the sensor to pin 2 on the Arduino and the ECHO pin to pin 3 and connect the positive pin of the piezoelectric buzzer to pin 8 on the Arduino and the negative pin to GND.
